How to play:

    1.Use your keys “w” for up, “s” for down, “d” for right, and “a” for left.
    
    2. If you run the snake into the wall or its own tail: you lose.
    
    3. Eat the red balls to grow longer and gain points.
    
    4. For faster/slower speeds, go to options.
    
    
ENJOY!! :)
